            <h3>To-Do list</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Brief:</strong> I created a simple to-do list where people
              can add, edit, and delete tasks. A to-do list is basically a way
              to organise your day—people use it so they don’t forget important
              things, and it helps them stay focused and productive.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> HTML and CSS</p>
            <p>
              <strong>Responsibilities:</strong>When building it, my
              responsibilities included designing the layout using HTML and CSS,
              making sure it looked clean and easy to read, and using JavaScript
              to make it interactive. I had to make sure tasks could be added,
              checked off when completed, and removed if no longer needed. I
              also focused on keeping the code neat and easy to understand, so
              it could be improved in the future.
